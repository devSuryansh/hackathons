# Stillroom

Stillroom is a browser logbook for people who study in rooms they do not control. It measures how loud the space is, records focus sessions, and draws a seven-day map of when the room actually goes quiet.

## The idea

I have lost more evenings to "I'll start when it gets quieter" than I have to hard problem sets. Hostels, shared flats, and cafes do not publish a schedule for when the hallway goes still. You guess. You put on headphones. You still jump when a door slams.

Stillroom started as a way to stop guessing. If the room has a pattern, a week of measurements should show it. If it does not, you learn that too, and you stop waiting for a silence that is never coming.

## How it works

Open the app and allow the microphone. Stillroom uses the Web Audio API on this device. Sound is processed locally and never uploaded.

The meter maps microphone RMS onto a 0-100 room score. Quiet is 32 and below. Workable holds until 55. Above that the room is loud.

Start a focus session when you sit down. Stillroom samples the score several times a second, counts interruptions when loudness stays high instead of spiking once, and writes a summary when you stop. Those samples also fill a 7-by-24 heatmap. From that grid it ranks the quietest two-hour blocks in your week.

Everything lives in `localStorage` on this browser. The map starts empty. It fills as you measure. Clear measurements if you want a blank log.

## Main features

- Live room meter with a needle gauge and a scrolling loudness trace
- Microphone input on this device, no account
- Focus sessions with duration, average score, quiet share, and interruption count
- Interruption detection with hysteresis, so one door slam is not three events
- Seven-day hush map, one cell per hour
- Quietest two-hour block ranking
- Local-only storage

## Technology stack

- TypeScript
- Vite
- Vanilla DOM (no UI framework)
- Web Audio API (`AudioContext`, `AnalyserNode`, `getUserMedia`)
- `localStorage` for persistence
- Vitest for unit tests covering scoring, sessions, heatmap buckets, and storage parsing

## Intended audience

Students and anyone else who works in shared housing, hostels, or noisy cafes and wants a factual answer to "when is this place actually quiet?" It is also a small, inspectable Web Audio project if you are learning how to turn a microphone stream into something you can reason about.

## Team

Solo submission for the [Build Beyond Hackathon](https://build-beyond-hackathon.devpost.com/).

- **Suryansh Singh** (GitHub: [devSuryansh](https://github.com/devSuryansh), Devpost: [devSuryansh](https://devpost.com/devSuryansh)). Idea, design, engineering, and writeup.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run dev
```

`npm test` should print a passing Vitest summary. `npm run dev` starts Vite. The app is a static page, so `npm run build` and `npm run preview` are enough for a production-like check.

Devpost paste copy lives in [`DEVPOST.md`](DEVPOST.md).
